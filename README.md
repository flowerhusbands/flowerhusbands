### Bmf // Info !!

Hiya ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ I go by Zee or Zia but really any name is  fine cause I dont really care what people call me !!</br>

I dont have an age DNI list so as long as youre not a creep feel free to interact and talk to me ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧</br>

I have loads of interests such as mcyt, alnst, pjsk, vocaloid, hsr, and so much more !! I also love to talk to people so please do so ◝(ᵔᗜᵔ)◜</br>

Also I dont like to cover people so please if you wanna sit with me dont be afraid to cover me :D </br>

Another thing I should probably add is im not the best at keeping up conversations or friendships.. Im a really paranoid person and it often takes me a lot of courage to interact or chat with others even if we're already friends :c for some reason my brain thinks : "youre gonna say the wrong thing !! make a bad impression yk.. heh.. best not interact at all !!" or something along those lines.. Again if this throws you off I do apologise !! Its something ive been trying to work on.. i promise 😢 </br>
