### INFO + BYI
<sub>this is basically just a summary of my strawpage which you should.. totally go read :c </sub><br>

HIIII I go by Zee or Zia ^^ any name is perfectly fine., <br>
you can even make your own name if you'd like !! <br>
as long as I know that you're addressing me then any name works !!<br>

I use she/they pronouns :D.. again, I really dont mind which you use ^^<br>
 
Im a bit unsocial at times, its something ive been hoping to change.. <br>
depending on the person and mood I might not be as open to interact <br>
especially when its in a big group of people.. so if I dont talk., dont take it to heart<br>
Often, this also means im not great at keeping up friendships, <br>
Again, I do apologise.., I tend overthink things a lot so its just easier if I dont interact<br>
Despite this I love listening to people and love when others interact !! <br>

So feel free to interact first tho !! I dont bite :P ^^ promise..<br>
