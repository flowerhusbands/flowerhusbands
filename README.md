### INFO + BYI
<sub>this is basically just a summary of my strawpage which you should.. totally go read :c </sub><br>

HIIII I go by Zee or Zia ^^ any name is fine., <br>
you can even make your own name !! <br>
as long as I know that you're addressing me then any name works!<br>

I use she/they pronouns :D.. Again, I dont mind which you use ^^<br>
 
Im a bit unsocial at times, its a problem ive been working on.. <br>
depending on the person I might not be as open to interact <br>
especially when its in a big group of people..<br>
Often, this means im not great at keeping up friendships, <br>
So if I dont interact I do apologise.., I overthink things a lot..,<br>

Feel free to interact first tho !! I dont bite :P ^^ promise..<br>
